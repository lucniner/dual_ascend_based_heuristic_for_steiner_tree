# shortest path heuristic and dual ascend

This repository is for the second programming exercise in Networks Design and Analysis summer term 2018 at the technical university of vienna.


## Build

To build the code and run with default values simply execute the following:

```shell
./gradlew clean jar
cd build/libs/
java -jar dual_ascend_based_heuristic_for_steiner_tree.jar
```

The following options are available and can be displayed when adding the -h flag to the jar execution. 

```shell
usage: java -jar <name> [-a] [-d <arg>] [-f <arg>] [-h] [-v]
 -a,--dualAscent        use dual ascent before shortest path heuristic
 -d,--directory <arg>   load all instances from given directory
 -f,--file <arg>        load instance from given file
 -h,--help              print this message
 -v,--visualize         visualization of the output
```

## Implementation

The implementation assumes that the input graph follows the [steinlib format](http://steinlib.zib.de/format.php). The documentation for Edges and Arcs is not accurate on the website so we decided to use for Edges the following meaning: First and Second number are nodes, third number is the weight. For Arcs it is the same we simply use the last number as weight.

## Test Instance
The implementation got tested with instances from [steinlib](http://steinlib.zib.de/download.php).

## Visualization

For the shortest path there is a visualization for steiner trees available. It simply prints the input graph and marks the path taken, as well as terminals. Visualization is done with the GraphStream API.
